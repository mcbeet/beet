# Beet documentation

Welcome! This is the place where you'll eventually find everything there is to know about the `beet` project. The documentation is currently a work-in-progress. You're welcome to help write guides and contribute example use-cases. In the meantime, don't be afraid to check out the code!

You can follow the development of the project, discuss ideas, get help, and hang out with cool people interested in map-making and programming on our brand new discord! You can also ask questions about `beet` and get general help about Minecraft map-making on the Minecraft Commands discord server.
