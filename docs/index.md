# Welcome

This is the place where you'll eventually find everything there is to know about the Beet project. The documentation is currently a work-in-progress. You're welcome to help write guides and contribute example use-cases. In the meantime, don't be afraid to check out the code!

You can follow the development of the project, discuss ideas, get help, and hang out with cool people interested in map-making and programming on our discord! You can also ask questions about Beet and get general help about Minecraft map-making on the Minecraft Commands discord server.

## Introduction

Minecraft [resource packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack) and [data packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) work well as _distribution_ formats but can be pretty limiting as _authoring_ formats. You can quickly end up having to manage hundreds of files, some of which might be buried within the bundled output of various generators.

The Beet project is a development kit that tries to unify data pack and resource pack tooling into a single pipeline. The community is always coming up with pre-processors, frameworks, and generators of all kinds to make the developer experience more ergonomic. With Beet you can seamlessly integrate all these tools in your project.
